# Object Detection Model Deployment Project

## Overview

This comprehensive project involves the creation and deployment of a sophisticated object detection model. The key aspects include:

### 1. Data Collection for 28 Classes
- Manually gathered diverse data for 28 different classes, ensuring a robust foundation for model training.

### 2. Data Creation with Pose Estimation
- Leveraged Mediapipe for pose estimation to augment the dataset, enhancing the model's performance across various scenarios.

### 3. Model Training Across 28 Classes
- Trained both Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to achieve accurate object detection for each of the 28 classes.

### 4. Rigorous Live Video Testing
- Conducted thorough testing of the trained models using live video feeds, ensuring real-time performance and reliability.

### 5. Deployment with Flask
- Implemented deployment using Flask, providing a user-friendly interface for practical utilization of the trained models.
